<br>
<p class="indent">What does it mean to mean something? In the case of a word, is it only what it is defined as, or does it stand for something else beyond its given concept? When we try to establish the definition of a word, we reach out for the dictionary on the shelf (or more commonly these days, one would type in a search bar in a browser.) What would be the definition of the word »&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;« ? According to <span class="citeName">Oxford Dictionaries</span> it is defines as <span class="citeNum"><a><abbr title="Oxford Dictionary, http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/meaning." rel="tooltip">&#8672; 1]</abbr></a></span> :</p>
<blockquote>
    NOUN<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is meant by a word, text, concept, or action;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Implied or explicit significance;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Important or worthwhile quality; purpose.<br><br>
    ADJECTIVE [ATTRIBUTIVE]<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Intended to communicate something that is not directly expressed.
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning given is restricted to its intended definition; to mean exactly what it stands for. If a word is put in a different and/or wider context, it is thereby conditioned to have its denotation modified. When this happens, implicit connotations and suggestions can be formed.  </p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances and in what context a word is used, it can be defined in multiple and varied ways. Its meaning can be manipulated, expressed or perceived in and from many different angles. The archetype of a word is »&nbsp;black and white&nbsp;« . If manipulated, it can stand for other meanings aside from its pre-defined self. However, this act goes beyond the pages of a dictionary. It requires an activated reader to participate and define for themselves what it means and implies to the them.</p>

<blockquote>
People talk about the purpose of life, but I don’t think that my life has any innate purpose, nor does anyone else’s life. Living is about experiencing the world, fulfilling your curiosities and expressing yourself. Everyone has a different approach to living and to expression. But regardless of method, we all strive to attain the same goal: individual freedom, independent thinking and individual consciousness. This is the path to a healthy society &#133; I enjoy constructive communication and the exchange of ideas. It is my biggest pleasure to see the impossible become possible through individuals interacting with each other.
</blockquote>
<p>In opening up a dialogue, words are exchanged verbally or transcribed in written or printed form. Words give rise to the sharing of ideas, differing viewpoints, and opening up arguments and possible new perspectives. <span class="citeNum"><a><abbr title="“One day a friend pointed out an article by Heinrich von Kleist, who had exhaustively devised the explanation for my tendency to enter a conversation with no concept whatsoever, yet to depart with a firm plan.” Erik Spiekermann, ‘Introduction’ in »On the gradual completion of thoughts during speech«, United Designers Network, 2006." rel="tooltip">&#8672; 3]</abbr></a></span></p>
<p>We consciously search for a purpose to validate our existential state.

<p>By uncovering our inner consciousness, these new concepts lead to new perspectives and ideas that would not have prevailed before.

<p class="subTitleText">breaking the Meaning</p>
<br>
<p>We live in a society where we accept and follow most conventions blindly without questioning them. We are all expected to conform to these conditions. If one breaks any of these man-made societal contracts, one runs the risk of being judged, or criticised. It is then perhaps we find ourselves wondering and searching the meaning and purpose of our lives.</p>
<p>We are living in a same continuous loop without a constant refresh button when there are conditions already set and pre-defined. How do we find answers if we don’t take a step back and re-evaluate our surroundings? We live in this fear of uncertainty, apprehensive towards anything that manifest subjectivity.</p>
<p>To embrace new ideas and to open ourselves to different possibilities, this resistance to change requires the broadening of the mind. In order to expand our thinking and live more consciously, we need to question and challenge what is existing or familiar. Words that form language, and as a dialogue offer possible paths to alternative knowledge.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="subTitleText">making new Meanings</p>
<br>
<p>Everyday we are confronted with surroundings that shape and mould our existence. Amongst the plethora of happenings and physical tangible landscapes, » intangible subjects « exist within the borders of reality and non-reality. These hidden matters and messages, encoded within signs and symbols, form » invisible realms « . They exist in multitudes of forms—these invisible domains only become visible and come into existence when a reader is presented clues of their formations. <span class="citeNum"><a><abbr title="“… it is the prerogative of the player rather than the artist, … to confront any larger meanings that might be drawn from this experience.” Lynne Cooke, »Introduction to Claude Closky’s <i>Do you want love or lust?</i>«, Dia Art Foundation, http://awp.diaart.org/closky/intro.php." rel="tooltip">&#8672; 6]</abbr></a></span></p>
<p>In the article »&nbsp;Introduction to Claude Closky’s ‘Do you want love or lust’?&nbsp;« , the artist <span class="citeName">Clause Closky</span>’s explaination sums up this concept <span class="citeNum"><a><abbr title="Lynne Cooke, »Introduction to Claude Closky’s <i>Do you want love or lust?</i>«, Dia Art Foundation, http://awp.diaart.org/closky/intro.php." rel="tooltip">&#8672; 7]</abbr></a></span> :</p>
<blockquote>&#133; Everyday encounters stimulate me. The reflex is important &#133; Sometimes it is as if the piece already existed in the material I am using, so that all I have to do is to isolate a section &#133; and look at it from a different angle. And that new point of view comes from my immediate reaction to my everyday life.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<p class="subTitleText">Meaning not found</p>
<br>
<p>Nothing is strictly linear. There is no absolute answers or definitions in most matters, only »&nbsp;grey areas&nbsp;« . In our attempts to make sense of this world, we seek to experience in order to discover and define our existing selves. We know for certain our beings exist, but are not able to »&nbsp;see&nbsp;« ourselves. In turn, our beings come into a state of subjectivity; thus the many societal conditions are set out to enforce us into »&nbsp;objective beings&nbsp;« .</p>
<p>Will we ever find the »&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;« ? Will alternate prescribed meanings bring any new meanings or lead to fresh perspectives? Whatever the outcome, words manifests themselves through language and become a form of rhetoric. In turn, words are essential in creating discourse and communicating ideas. These can be new forms of viewpoints. But there is no meaning to be found, unless there is an active receiver. It is up to the reader how he/she wants to define the »&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;« . <span class="wordCount">&#8672; 953 words]</span></p>
