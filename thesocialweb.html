                <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Social Web Incubator Group investigates how, through the use of web standards (such as HTML, OpenSocial or FOAF), an interoperable set of online social technologies can be developed and sustainably maintained.</p>
                <p>Looking at another prominent adopter of “federated” terminology, the Federated Social Web W3C community group seems to have yet another conception of what it means for a network to be federated. According to the announcement of their Federated Social Web Summit in 2010, federation (in the context of social networks) is “letting people on different social networks follow each other”. The focus is in this case not so much on network architecture, but rather on data exchange: the FSW proposes that different networks adopt one unified data architecture so that a robust, heterogeneous network-of-networks can emerge. So for the FSW initiative, federation can be achieved through standardization of data formats: the precise connection between nodes and server is less relevant.</p>
                <p>Having looked at several different ways of using these labels, where does this bring us? Apparently there’s no single agreed-upon definition of what a federated network is: there’s subtle differences between how the cited authors use this and other labels and sometimes the definitions that seem to be used even contradict each other. This is obviously a problem if one would want to discuss “federated networks” in a general sense.</p>
                <p>The most sensible approach might be that of Narayanan et al, who use “decentralized” as an umbrella label that includes both federated and distributed networks. Semantically this is a solid categorization, as both types of network are indeed not centralized. As both federated and distributed networks have “not being centralized” as one of their main distinguishing features, it makes sense to include them in one category based on that characteristic.</p>
                <p>Looking at just the “federated” label, what most authors seem to agree on is that a federated network is the same “distributed network of centralized networks” that Baran called decentralized. So in that sense, “federated” has replaced “decentralized” in its original meaning, while “decentralized” has been adopted in various different ways, mostly as an umbrella term. This is a reasonable redefinition, considering the fact that a distributed network could technically also be considered to be decentralized, and the close resemblance of the federated structure to the structure of a political federation, where autonomous sub-entities (such as American states) form one single larger entity (the United States).</p>
                <p>The most workable middle ground, then, seems to be that a federated network is a distributed network with each node of this distributed network being a centralized network. Such a federated network is a type of decentralized network, with another type of such a network being the distributed network.</p>
