<p class="subTitleText">Meaning Of Meaning</p>
<br>
<p class="indent">What does it mean to mean something? In the case a word, is it only what it is defined as, or does it stand for something else beyond its given concept? When we try to establish the definition of a word, we reach out to a dictionary (or more commonly these days, one would type in a search bar.) For example, the word&nbsp;&nbsp;»&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;«&nbsp;&nbsp;as defined by <span class="citeName">Oxford Dictionaries</span> &#8672; <span class="citeNum">1]</span> :</p>
<blockquote>
    NOUN<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is meant by a word, text, concept, or action;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Implied or explicit significance;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Important or worthwhile quality; purpose.<br><br>
    ADJECTIVE [ATTRIBUTIVE]<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Intended to communicate something that is not directly expressed.
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning given is restricted to its intended definition; to mean exactly what it stands for. If a word is put in a different (and/or wider) context, it is thereby conditioned to have its denotation modified. When this happens, implicit connotations and suggestions can be formed.
<br><br>
Depending on the circumstances and in which context a word is used, it can be defined in multiple and varied ways. Its meaning can be manipulated, expressed or perceived in and from many different angles. Words stand for themselves—they are black and white. However, when manipulated, can stand for other meanings other than their pre-defined selves. This act goes beyond the pages of a dictionary. It requires the activated reader to participate and define for themselves what it means and implies to the spectator.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="subTitleText">Finding The Meaning</p>
<br>
<p>In his short essay&nbsp;&nbsp;»&nbsp;On Living&nbsp;«&nbsp;&nbsp;published in <span class="citeName">apartamento #10</span>, the artist <span class="citeName">Ai Weiwei</span> writes &#8672; <span class="citeNum">2]</span> :</p>
<blockquote>
People talk about the purpose of life, but I don’t think that my life has any innate purpose, nor does anyone else’s life. Living is about experiencing the world, fulfilling your curiosities and expressing yourself. Everyone has a different approach to living and to expression. But regardless of method, we all strive to attain the same goal: individual freedom, independent thinking and individual consciousness. This is the path to a healthy society &#133; I enjoy constructive communication and the exchange of ideas. It is my biggest pleasure to see the impossible become possible through individuals interacting with each other.
</blockquote>
<p>In opening up a dialogue, words are exchanged verbally or transcribed in written or printed form. Words give rise to the sharing of ideas, differing viewpoints, and opening up arguments and perspectives. We consciously search for a purpose to validate our existential state. Words when expressed as a language other than their intended meanings, could offer the possibilities of unlocking our unconscious state of mind.
<br><br>
By uncovering our inner consciousness, these new concepts lead to new perspectives and ideas that would not have prevailed before. They can lead us towards achieving <span class="citeName">individual freedom, independent thinking and individual consciousness.</span> &#8672; <span class="citeNum">3]</span></p>
<br><br>
<p class="subTitleText">Breaking The Meaning</p>
<br>
<p>We live in a society where conventions are blindly followed and accepted. We are all expected to conform to these conditions. If one breaks any of these man-made societal contracts, one runs the risk of being judged or possibly even shunned. It is no wonder we find ourselves wondering and searching the meaning and purpose of our lives. We are living in a same continuous loop without a constant refresh button. The conditions are all already set and pre-defined. How do we hope to find answers if we don’t take a step back and revaluate our surroundings? In living with this fear of uncertainty, we seem to fear anything that manifests subjectivity.</p>
<p>To embrace new ideas and to open ourselves to different possibilities, this resistance to change requires the broadening of the mind. In order to expand our thinking and live more consciously, we need to question and challenge what is existing or familiar. Words that form language, and as a dialogue offer possible paths to alternative knowledge.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="subTitleText">Making New Meanings</p>
<br>
<p>Everyday we are confronted with surroundings that shape and mould our existence. Amongst this plethora of happenings and physical tangible landscapes, there are intangible subjects that exist on the borders of reality and non-reality. These hidden matters and messages, encoded within signs and symbols, form an invisible realm. They exist in multitudes of forms—this invisible realm only becomes visible and come into existence when the reader is presented clues of its formation; <span class="citeName">… it is the prerogative of the player rather than the artist, &#133; to confront any larger meanings that might be drawn from this experience.</span> &#8672; <span class="citeNum">4]</span></p>
<p>In the article&nbsp;&nbsp;»&nbsp;Introduction to Claude Closky’s Do you want love or lust?&nbsp;«,&nbsp;&nbsp;the artist <span class="citeName">Clause Closky</span> sums it up well with his words &#8672; <span class="citeNum">5]</span> :</p>
<blockquote>&#133; Everyday encounters stimulate me. The reflex is important &#133; Sometimes it is as if the piece already existed in the material I am using, so that all I have to do is to isolate a section &#133; and look at it from a different angle. And that new point of view comes from my immediate reaction to my everyday life.</blockquote>
<br><br>
<p class="subTitleText">Meaning Not Found</p>
<br>
<p>Nothing is ever linear. There is no absolute answers or definitions in most matters, only grey areas. In our attempt to make sense of this world, we seek to experience in order to discover and define our existing selves. We know for certain our beings exist, but are not able to see ourselves. In turn our beings come into the being of subjectivity; thus the many societal conditions are set out to enforce us into objective beings.</p>
<p>Will we ever find the meaning? Will the new prescribed meanings bring any meanings or lead to new perspectives? Whatever the outcome, words manifests themselves through language and become a form of rhetoric. In turn, words are essential in creating discourse and communicating ideas. These can be new forms of viewpoints. But there is no meaning to be found, unless there is an active receiver. It is up to the reader how he/she wants to define the meaning. &#8672; <span class="citeNum">970 words]</span></p>
